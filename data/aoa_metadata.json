    "clause_text": "Directors  to take decisions collectively (1) \tThe general rule about decision-making by directors is that any decision \tof the directors must be either a majority decision at a meeting or a \tdecision taken in accordance with article 8. (2) If— the company only has one director, and no provision of the articles requires it to have more than one director, the general rule does not apply, and the director may take decisions without regard to any of the provisions of the articles relating to directors’ decision-making. Unanimous  decisions (1)\tA decision of the directors is taken in accordance with this article when all eligible directors indicate to each other by any means that they share a common view on a matter. (2) \tSuch a decision may take the form of a resolution in writing, copies of which have been signed by each eligible director or to which each eligible director has otherwise indicated agreement in writing. (3) \tReferences in this article to eligible directors are to directors who would have been entitled to vote on the matter had it been proposed as a resolution at a directors’ meeting. (4) \tA decision may not be taken in accordance with this article if the eligible directors would not have formed a quorum at such a meeting. Calling a directors’ meeting (1) \tAny director may call a directors’ meeting by giving notice of the meeting to the directors or by authorising the company secretary (if any) to give such notice. (2) \tNotice of any directors’ meeting must indicate its proposed date and time, where it is to take place, and if it is anticipated that directors participating in the meeting will not be in the same place, how it is proposed that they should communicate with each other during the meeting. (3)\tNotice of a directors’ meeting must be given to each director, but need not be in writing. (4)\tNotice of a directors’ meeting need not be given to directors who waive their entitlement to notice of that meeting, by giving notice to that effect to the company not more than 7 days after the date on which the meeting is held. Where such notice is given after the meeting has been held, that does not affect the validity of the meeting, or of any business conducted at it. Participation in directors’ meetings (1) \tSubject  to  the  articles,  directors  participate  in  a  directors’  meeting,  \tor  part  of  a directors’ meeting, when— the meeting has been called and takes place in accordance with the articles, and they can each communicate to the others any information or opinions they have on any particular item of the business of the meeting. (2)\tIn determining whether directors are participating in a directors’ meeting, it is irrelevant where any director is or how they communicate with each other. (3)\tIf all the directors participating in a meeting are not in the same place, they may decide that the meeting is to be treated as taking place wherever any of them is. Quorum for directors’ meetings (1)\tAt a directors’ meeting, unless a quorum is participating, no proposal is \tto be voted on, except a proposal to call another meeting. (2) \tThe quorum for directors’ meetings may be fixed from time to time by a decision of the directors, but it must never be less than two, and unless otherwise fixed it is two. (3) \tIf the total number of directors for the time being is less than the quorum required, the directors must not take any decision other than a decision— to appoint further directors, or to call a general meeting so as to enable the shareholders to appoint further directors. Chairing of directors’ meetings (1) \tThe directors may appoint a director to chair their meetings. (2) \tThe person so appointed for the time being is known as the chairman. (3) \tThe directors may terminate the chairman’s appointment at any time. (4) \tIf the chairman is not participating in a directors’ meeting within ten minutes of the time at which it was to start, the participating directors must appoint one of themselves to chair it. Casting vote (1) \tIf the numbers of votes for and against a proposal are equal, the \tchairman or other director chairing the meeting has a casting vote. (2)\tBut this does not apply if, in accordance with the articles, the chairman or other director is not to be counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum or voting purposes. Conflicts of interest (1)\tIf a proposed decision of the directors is concerned with an actual \tor proposed transaction or arrangement with the company in which a director is interested, that director is not to be counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum or voting purposes. (2) \tBut if paragraph (3) applies, a director who is interested in an actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the company is to be counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum and voting purposes. (3) \tThis paragraph applies when— the company by ordinary resolution disapplies the provision of the articles which would otherwise prevent a director from being counted as participating in the decision-making process, the director’s interest cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest, or the director’s conflict of interest arises from a permitted cause. (4) \tFor the purposes of this article, the following are permitted causes— a guarantee given, or to be given, by or to a director in respect of an obligation incurred by or on behalf of the company or any of its subsidiaries, subscription, or an agreement to subscribe, for shares or other securities of the company or any of its subsidiaries, or to underwrite, sub-underwrite, or guarantee subscription for any such shares or securities, and arrangements pursuant to which benefits are made available to employees and directors or former employees and directors of the company or any of its subsidiaries which do not provide special benefits for directors or former directors. (5) \tFor  the  purposes  of  this  article,  references  to  proposed  decisions  and  decision-making processes include any directors’ meeting or part of a directors’ meeting. (6) \tSubject to paragraph (7), if a question arises at a meeting of directors or of a committee of directors as to the right of a director to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes, the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be referred to the chairman whose ruling in relation to any director other than the chairman is to be final and conclusive. (7)\tIf any question as to the right to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) should arise in respect of the chairman, the question is to be decided by a decision of the directors at that meeting, for which purpose the chairman is not to be counted as participating in the meeting (or that part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes. Records of decisions to be kept The directors must ensure that the company keeps a record, in writing, for at least 10 years from the date of the decision recorded, of every unanimous or majority decision taken by the directors. Directors’  discretion  to make further rules Subject to the articles, the directors may make any rule which they think fit about how they take decisions, and about how such rules are to be recorded or communicated to directors."

Content of proxy notices (1) \tProxies may only validly be appointed by a notice in writing (a  \t“proxy notice”) which— states the name and address of the shareholder appointing the proxy, identifies the person appointed to be that shareholder’s proxy and the general meeting in relation to which that person is appointed, is signed by or on behalf of the shareholder appointing the proxy, or is authenticated in such manner as the directors may determine, and is delivered to the company in accordance with the articles and any instructions contained in the notice of the general meeting to which they relate. (2) \tThe company may require proxy notices to be delivered in a particular form, and may specify different forms for different purposes. (3) \tProxy notices may specify how the proxy appointed under them is to vote (or that the proxy is to abstain from voting) on one or more resolutions. (4) \tUnless a proxy notice indicates otherwise, it must be treated as— allowing the person appointed under it as a proxy discretion as to how to vote on any ancillary or procedural resolutions put to the meeting, and appointing that person as a proxy in relation to any adjournment of the general meeting to which it relates as well as the meeting itself. Delivery of proxy notices (1)\tA person who is entitled to attend, speak or vote (either on a show of \thands or on a poll) at a general meeting remains so entitled in respect of \tthat meeting or any adjournment of it, even though a valid proxy notice \thas been delivered to the company by or on behalf of that person. (2) \tAn appointment under a proxy notice may be revoked by delivering to the company a notice in writing given by or on behalf of the person by whom or on whose behalf the proxy notice was given. (3) \tA notice revoking a proxy appointment only takes effect if it is delivered before the start of the meeting or adjourned meeting to which it relates. (4) \tIf a proxy notice is not executed by the person appointing the proxy, it must be accompanied by written evidence of the authority of the person who executed it to execute it on the appointor’s behalf. Amendments to resolutions (1) \tAn ordinary resolution to be proposed at a general meeting may be  \tamended by ordinary resolution if— notice of the proposed amendment is given to the company in writing by a person entitled to vote at the general meeting at which it is to be proposed not less than 48 hours before the meeting is to take place (or such later time as the chairman of the meeting may determine), and the proposed amendment does not, in the reasonable opinion of the chairman of the meeting, materially alter the scope of the resolution. (2) \tA special resolution to be proposed at a general meeting may be amended by ordinary resolution, if— the chairman of the meeting proposes the amendment at the general meeting at which the resolution is to be proposed, and the amendment does not go beyond what is necessary to correct a grammatical or other non-substantive error in the resolution. (3) \tIf the chairman of the meeting, acting in good faith, wrongly decides that an amendment to a resolution is out of order, the chairman’s error does not invalidate the vote on that resolution."

Calling a directors’ meeting (1) \tAny director may call a directors’ meeting. (2) \tThe company secretary must call a directors’ meeting if a director so requests. (3) \tA directors’ meeting is called by giving notice of the meeting to the directors. (4) \tNotice of any directors’ meeting must indicate— its proposed date and time, where it is to take place, and if it is anticipated that directors participating in the meeting will not be in the same place, how it is proposed that they should communicate with each other during the meeting. (5) \tNotice of a directors’ meeting must be given to each director, but need not be in writing. (6) \tNotice of a directors’ meeting need not be given to directors who waive their entitlement to notice of that meeting, by giving notice to that effect to the company not more than 7 days after the date on which the meeting is held. Where such notice is given after the meeting has been held, that does not affect the validity of the meeting, or of any business conducted at it. Participation in directors’ meetings (1) \tSubject to the articles, directors participate in a directors’ meeting, or \tpart of a directors’ meeting, when— the meeting has been called and takes place in accordance with the articles, and they can each communicate to the others any information or opinions they have on any particular item of the business of the meeting. (2) \tIn determining whether directors are participating in a directors’ meeting, it is irrelevant where any director is or how they communicate with each other. (3) \tIf all the directors participating in a meeting are not in the same place, they may decide that the meeting is to be treated as taking place wherever any of them is. Quorum for directors’ meetings (1) \tAt a directors’ meeting, unless a quorum is participating, no proposal is \tto be voted on, except a proposal to call another meeting. (2) \tThe quorum for directors’ meetings may be fixed from time to time by a decision of the directors, but it must never be less than two, and unless otherwise fixed it is two. Meetings where total number of directors less than quorum (1) \tThis article applies where the total number of directors for the time \tbeing is less than the quorum for directors’ meetings. (2) \tIf there is only one director, that director may appoint sufficient directors to make up a quorum or call a general meeting to do so. (3) \tIf there is more than one director— a directors’ meeting may take place, if it is called in accordance with the articles and at least two directors participate in it, with a view to appointing sufficient directors to make up a quorum or calling a general meeting to do so, and if a directors’ meeting is called but only one director attends at the appointed date and time to participate in it, that director may appoint sufficient directors to make up a quorum or call a general meeting to do so. Chairing directors’ meetings (1) \tThe directors may appoint a director to chair their meetings. (2) \tThe person so appointed for the time being is known as the chairman. (3) \tThe directors may appoint other directors as deputy or assistant chairmen to chair directors’ meetings in the chairman’s absence. (4) \tThe directors may terminate the appointment of the chairman, deputy or assistant chairman at any time. (5) \tIf neither the chairman nor any director appointed generally to chair directors’ meetings in the chairman’s absence is participating in a meeting within ten minutes of the time at which it was to start, the participating directors must appoint one of themselves to chair it. Voting at directors’ meetings: general rules (1) \tSubject to the articles, a decision is taken at a directors’ meeting by a \tmajority of the votes of the participating directors. (2) \tSubject to the articles, each director participating in a directors’ meeting has one vote. (3) \tSubject to the articles, if a director has an interest in an actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the company— that director and that director’s alternate may not vote on any proposal relating to it, but this  does  not  preclude  the  alternate  from  voting  in  relation  to  that  transaction  or arrangement on behalf of another appointor who does not have such an interest. Chairman’s casting vote at directors’ meetings (1) \tIf the numbers of votes for and against a proposal are equal, the \tchairman or other director chairing the meeting has a casting vote. (2) \tBut this does not apply if, in accordance with the articles, the chairman or other director is not to be counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum or voting purposes. Alternates voting at directors’ meetings A director who is also an alternate  director has an additional vote on behalf  of each appointor who is— not participating in a directors’ meeting, and would have been entitled to vote if they were participating in it. Conflicts of interest (1) \tIf a directors’ meeting, or part of a directors’ meeting, is concerned \twith an actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the company \tin which a director is interested, that director is not to be counted as \tparticipating in that meeting, or part of a meeting, for quorum or voting \tpurposes. (2) \tBut if paragraph (3) applies, a director who is interested in an actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the company is to be counted as participating in a decision at a directors’ meeting, or part of a directors’ meeting, relating to it for quorum and voting purposes. (3) \tThis paragraph applies when— the company by ordinary resolution disapplies the provision of the articles which would otherwise prevent a director from being counted as participating in, or voting at, a directors’ meeting, the director’s interest cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest, or the director’s conflict of interest arises from a permitted cause. (4) \tFor the purposes of this article, the following are permitted causes— a guarantee given, or to be given, by or to a director in respect of an obligation incurred by or on behalf of the company or any of its subsidiaries, subscription, or an agreement to subscribe, for shares or other securities of the company or any of its subsidiaries, or to underwrite, sub-underwrite, or guarantee subscription for any such shares or securities, and arrangements pursuant to which benefits are made available to employees and directors or former employees and directors of the company or any of its subsidiaries which do not provide special benefits for directors or former directors. (5) \tSubject to paragraph (6), if a question arises at a meeting of directors or of a committee of directors as to the right of a director to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes, the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be referred to the chairman whose ruling in relation to any director other than the chairman is to be final and conclusive. (6) \tIf any question as to the right to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) should arise in respect of the chairman, the question is to be decided by a decision of the directors at that meeting, for which purpose the chairman is not to be counted as participating in the meeting (or that part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes. Proposing directors’ written resolutions (1) \tAny director may propose a directors’ written resolution. (2) \tThe company secretary must propose a directors’ written resolution if a director so requests. (3) \tA directors’ written resolution is proposed by giving notice of the proposed resolution to the directors. (4) \tNotice of a proposed directors’ written resolution must indicate— the proposed resolution, and the time by which it is proposed that the directors should adopt it. (5) \tNotice of a proposed directors’ written resolution must be given in writing to each director. (6) \tAny decision which a person giving notice of a proposed directors’ written resolution takes regarding the process of adopting that resolution must be taken reasonably in good faith. Adoption of directors’ written resolutions (1) \tA proposed directors’ written resolution is adopted when all the \tdirectors who would have been entitled to vote on the resolution at a \tdirectors’ meeting have signed one or more copies of it, provided that \tthose directors would have formed a quorum at such a meeting. (2) \tIt is immaterial whether any director signs the resolution before or after the time by which the notice proposed that it should be adopted. (3) \tOnce a directors’ written resolution has been adopted, it must be treated as if it had been a decision taken at a directors’ meeting in accordance with the articles. (4) \tThe company secretary must ensure that the company keeps a record, in writing, of all directors’ written resolutions for at least ten years from the date of their adoption. Directors’ discretion to make further rules Subject to the articles, the directors may make any rule which they think fit about how they take decisions, and about how such rules are to be recorded or communicated to directors."

Errors and disputes (1) \tNo objection may be raised to the qualification of any person voting \tat a general meeting except at the meeting or adjourned meeting at \twhich the vote objected to is tendered, and every vote not disallowed at \tthe meeting is valid. (2) \tAny such objection must be referred to the chairman of the meeting whose decision is final. Demanding a poll (1) \tA poll on a resolution may be demanded— in advance of the general meeting where it is to be put to the vote, or at a general meeting, either before a show of hands on that resolution or immediately after the result of a show of hands on that resolution is declared. (2) \tA poll may be demanded by— the chairman of the meeting, the directors, two or more persons having the right to vote on the resolution, or a person or persons representing not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the members having the right to vote on the resolution. (3) \tA demand for a poll may be withdrawn if— the poll has not yet been taken, and the chairman of the meeting consents to the withdrawal. Procedure on a poll (1) \tSubject to the articles, polls at general meetings must be taken when, \twhere and in such manner as the chairman of the meeting directs. (2) \tThe chairman of the meeting may appoint scrutineers (who need not be members) and decide how and when the result of the poll is to be declared. (3) \tThe result of a poll shall be the decision of the meeting in respect of the resolution on which the poll was demanded. (4) \tA poll on— the election of the chairman of the meeting, or a question of adjournment, must be taken immediately. (5) \tOther polls must be taken within 30 days of their being demanded. (6) \tA demand for a poll does not prevent a general meeting from continuing, except as regards the question on which the poll was demanded. (7) \tNo notice need be given of a poll not taken immediately if the time and place at which it is to be taken are announced at the meeting at which it is demanded. (8) \tIn any other case, at least 7 days’ notice must be given specifying the time and place at which the poll is to be taken. Content of proxy notices (1) \tProxies  may only  validly be  appointed  by a  notice  in  writing  (a  \t“proxy notice”)  which— states the name and address of the member appointing the proxy, identifies the person appointed to be that member’s proxy and the general meeting in relation to which that person is appointed, is signed by or on behalf of the member appointing the proxy, or is authenticated in such manner as the directors may determine, and is delivered to the company in accordance with the articles and any instructions contained in the notice of the general meeting to which they relate. (2) \tThe company may require proxy notices to be delivered in a particular form, and may specify different forms for different purposes. (3) \tProxy notices may specify how the proxy appointed under them is to vote (or that the proxy is to abstain from voting) on one or more resolutions. (4) \tUnless a proxy notice indicates otherwise, it must be treated as— allowing the person appointed under it as a proxy discretion as to how to vote on any ancillary or procedural resolutions put to the meeting, and appointing that person as a proxy in relation to any adjournment of the general meeting to which it relates as well as the meeting itself. Delivery of proxy notices (1) \tAny  notice  of  a  general  meeting  must  specify  the  address  or  \taddresses  (“proxy notification address”) at which the company or its \tagents will receive proxy notices relating to that meeting, or any \tadjournment of it, delivered in hard copy or electronic form. (2) \tA person who is entitled to attend, speak or vote (either on a show of hands or on a poll) at a general meeting remains so entitled in respect of that meeting or any adjournment of it, even though a valid proxy notice has been delivered to the company by or on behalf of that person. (3) \tSubject to paragraphs (4) and (5), a proxy notice must be delivered to a proxy notification address not less than 48 hours before the general meeting or adjourned meeting to which it relates. (4)\tIn the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours after it is demanded, the notice must be delivered to a proxy notification address not less than 24 hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll. (5)\tIn the case of a poll not taken during the meeting but taken not more than 48 hours after it was demanded, the proxy notice must be delivered— in accordance with paragraph (3), or at the meeting at which the poll was demanded to the chairman, secretary or any director. (6) \tAn appointment under a proxy notice may be revoked by delivering a notice in writing given by or on behalf of the person by whom or on whose behalf the proxy notice was given to a proxy notification address. (7) \tA notice revoking a proxy appointment only takes effect if it is delivered before— the start of the meeting or adjourned meeting to which it relates, or (in the case of a poll not taken on the same day as the meeting or adjourned meeting) the time appointed for taking the poll to which it relates. (8) \tIf a proxy notice is not signed by the person appointing the proxy, it must be accompanied by written evidence of the authority of the person who executed it to execute it on the appointor’s behalf. Amendments to resolutions (1) \tAn ordinary resolution to be proposed at  a  general  meeting  may be  \tamended  by ordinary resolution if— notice of the proposed amendment is given to the company secretary in writing by a person entitled to vote at the general meeting at which it is to be proposed not less than 48 hours before the meeting is to take place (or such later time as the chairman of the meeting may determine), and the proposed amendment does not, in the reasonable opinion of the chairman of the meeting, materially alter the scope of the resolution. (2) \tA special resolution to be proposed at a general meeting may be amended by ordinary resolution, if— the chairman of the meeting proposes the amendment at the general meeting at which the resolution is to be proposed, and the amendment does not go beyond what is necessary to correct a grammatical or other non-substantive error in the resolution. (3) \tIf the chairman of the meeting, acting in good faith, wrongly decides that an amendment to a resolution is out of order, the chairman’s error does not invalidate the vote on that resolution."

(2) \tThe company’s lien over a share— takes priority over any third party’s interest in that share, and extends to any dividend or other money payable by the company in respect of that share and (if the lien is enforced and the share is sold by the company) the proceeds of sale of that share. (3) \tThe directors may at any time decide that a share which is or would otherwise be subject to the company’s lien shall not be subject to it, either wholly or in part. Enforcement of the company’s lien (1) \tSubject to the provisions of this article, if— a lien enforcement notice has been given in respect of a share, and the person to whom the notice was given has failed to comply with it, the company may sell that share in such manner as the directors decide. (2) \tA lien enforcement notice— may only be given in respect of a share which is subject to the company’s lien, in respect of which a sum is payable and the due date for payment of that sum has passed, must specify the share concerned, must require payment of the sum payable within 14 days of the notice, must be addressed either to the holder of the share or to a person entitled to it by reason of the holder’s death, bankruptcy or otherwise, and must state the company’s intention to sell the share if the notice is not complied with. (3) \tWhere shares are sold under this article— the directors may authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares to the purchaser or a person nominated by the purchaser, and the  transferee  is  not  bound  to  see  to  the  application  of  the  consideration,  and  the transferee’s title is not affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the process leading to the sale. (4) \tThe net proceeds of any such sale (after payment of the costs of sale and any other costs of enforcing the lien) must be applied— first, in payment of so much of the sum for which the lien exists as was payable at the date of the lien enforcement notice, second, to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale, but only after the certificate for the shares sold has been surrendered to the company for cancellation or a suitable indemnity has been given for any lost certificates, and subject to a lien equivalent to the company’s lien over the shares before the sale for any money payable in respect of the shares after the date of the lien enforcement notice. (5) \tA statutory declaration by a director or the company secretary that the declarant is a director or the company secretary and that a share has been sold to satisfy the company’s lien on a specified date— is conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share, and subject to compliance with any other formalities of transfer required by the articles or by law, constitutes a good title to the share. Call notices (1) \tSubject to the articles and the terms on which shares are allotted, the \tdirectors may send a notice (a “call notice”) to a member requiring the \tmember to pay the company a specified sum of money (a “call”) which is payable in respect of shares which that member holds at the date when \tthe directors decide to send the call notice. (2) \tA call notice— may not require a member to pay a call which exceeds the total sum unpaid on that member’s shares, must state when and how any call to which it relates it is to be paid, and may permit or require the call to be paid by instalments. (3) \tA member must comply with the requirements of a call notice, but no member is obliged to pay any call before 14 days have passed since the notice was sent. (4) \tBefore the company has received any call due under a call notice the directors may— revoke it wholly or in part, or specify a later time for payment than is specified in the notice, by a further notice in writing to the member in respect of whose shares the call is made. Liability to pay calls (1) \tLiability to pay a call is not extinguished or transferred by transferring \tthe shares in respect of which it is required to be paid. (2) \tJoint holders of a share are jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect of that share. (3) Subject to the terms on which shares are allotted, the directors may, when issuing shares, provide that call notices sent to the holders of those shares may require them— to pay calls which are not the same, or to pay calls at different times. When call notice need not be issued (1) \tA call notice need not be issued in respect of sums which are specified, \tin the terms on which a share is issued, as being payable to the \tcompany in respect of that share — on allotment, on the occurrence of a particular event, or on a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue. (2) \tBut if the due date for payment of such a sum has passed and it has not been paid, the holder of the share concerned is treated in all respects as having failed to comply with a call notice in respect of that sum, and is liable to the same consequences as regards the payment of interest and forfeiture. Failure to comply with call notice: automatic consequences (1) \tIf a person is liable to pay a call and fails to do so by the call payment \tdate— the directors may issue a notice of intended forfeiture to that person, and until the call is paid, that person must pay the company interest on the call from the call payment date at the relevant rate. (2) \tFor the purposes of this article— the “call payment date” is the time when the call notice states that a call is payable, unless the directors give a notice specifying a later date, in which case the “call payment date” is that later date, the “relevant rate” is— the rate fixed by the terms on which the share in respect of which the call is due was allotted, such other rate as was fixed in the call notice which required payment of the call, or has otherwise been determined by the directors, or if no rate is fixed in either of these ways, 5 per cent per annum. (4) \tThe directors may waive any obligation to pay interest on a call wholly or in part. Notice of intended forfeiture A notice of intended forfeiture— may be sent in respect of any share in respect of which a call has not been paid as required by a call notice, must be sent to the holder of that share or to a person entitled to it by reason of the holder’s death, bankruptcy or otherwise, must require payment of the call and any accrued interest by a date which is not less than 14 days after the date of the notice, must state how the payment is to be made, and must state that if the notice is not complied with, the shares in respect of which the call is payable will be liable to be forfeited. Directors’ power to forfeit shares If a notice of intended forfeiture is not complied with before the date by which payment of the call is required in the notice of intended forfeiture, the directors may decide that any share in respect of which it was given is forfeited, and the forfeiture is to include all dividends or other moneys payable in respect of the forfeited shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Effect of forfeiture (1) \tSubject to the articles, the forfeiture of a share extinguishes all interests in that share, and all claims and demands against the company in respect of it, and all other rights and liabilities incidental to the share as between the person whose share it was prior to the forfeiture and the company. (2) \tAny share which is forfeited in accordance with the articles— is deemed to have been forfeited when the directors decide that it is forfeited, is deemed to be the property of the company, and may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of as the directors think fit. (3)\t If a person’s shares have been forfeited— the company must send that person notice that forfeiture has occurred and record it in the register of members, that person ceases to be a member in respect of those shares, that person must surrender the certificate for the shares forfeited to the company for cancellation, that person remains liable to the company for all sums payable by that person under the articles at the date of forfeiture in respect of those shares, including any interest (whether accrued before or after the date of forfeiture), and the directors may waive payment of such sums wholly or in part or enforce payment without any allowance for the value of the shares at the time of forfeiture or for any consideration received on their disposal. (4) \tAt any time before the company disposes of a forfeited share, the directors may decide to cancel the forfeiture on payment of all calls and interest due in respect of it and on such other terms as they think fit. Procedure following forfeiture (1) \tIf a forfeited share is to be disposed of by being transferred, the \tcompany may receive the consideration for the transfer and the directors \tmay authorise any person to execute the instrument of transfer. (2) \tA statutory declaration by a director or the company secretary that the declarant is a director or the company secretary and that a share has been forfeited on a specified date— is conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share, and subject to compliance with any other formalities of transfer required by the articles or by law, constitutes a good title to the share. (3) \tA person to whom a forfeited share is transferred is not bound to see to the application of the consideration (if any) nor is that person’s title to the share affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the process leading to the forfeiture or transfer of the share. (4) \tIf the company sells a forfeited share, the person who held it prior to its forfeiture is entitled to receive from the company the proceeds of such sale, net of any commission, and excluding any amount which— was, or would have become, payable, and had not, when that share was forfeited, been paid by that person in respect of that share, but  no interest is payable to such a person in respect of such proceeds and the company is not required to account for any money earned on them. Surrender of shares (1) \tA member may surrender any share— in respect of which the directors may issue a notice of intended forfeiture, which the directors may forfeit, or which has been forfeited. (2) \tThe directors may accept the surrender of any such share. (3) \tThe effect of surrender on a share is the same as the effect of forfeiture on that share. (4) \tA share which has been surrendered may be dealt with in the same way as a share which has been forfeited."

    "clause_text": "Procedure for declaring dividends (1) \tThe company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends, and the \tdirectors may decide to pay interim dividends. (2) \tA dividend must not be declared unless the directors have made a recommendation as to its amount. Such a dividend must not exceed the amount recommended by the directors. (3) \tNo dividend may be declared or paid unless it is in accordance with members’ respective rights. (4) \tUnless the members’ resolution to declare or directors’ decision to pay a dividend, or the terms  on  which  shares  are  issued,  specify  otherwise,  it  must  be  paid  by  reference  to  each member’s holding of shares on the date of the resolution or decision to declare or pay it. (5) \tIf the company’s share capital is divided into different classes, no interim dividend may be paid on shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any preferential dividend is in arrear. (6) \tThe directors may pay at intervals any dividend payable at a fixed rate if it appears to them that the profits available for distribution justify the payment. (7) \tIf the directors act in good faith, they do not incur any liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by the lawful payment of an interim dividend on shares with deferred or non-preferred rights. Calculation of dividends (1) \tExcept  as  otherwise  provided  by  the  articles  or  the  rights  attached  \tto  shares,  all dividends must be— declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares on which the dividend is paid, and apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid. (2) \tIf any share is issued on terms providing that it ranks for dividend as from a particular date, that share ranks for dividend accordingly. (3) \tFor the purposes of calculating dividends, no account is to be taken of any amount which has been paid up on a share in advance of the due date for payment of that amount. Payment of dividends and other distributions (1) \tWhere a dividend or other sum which is a distribution is payable in \trespect of a share, it must be paid by one or more of the following \tmeans— transfer to a bank account specified by the distribution recipient either in writing or as the directors may otherwise decide, sending a cheque made payable to the distribution recipient by post to the distribution recipient at the distribution recipient’s registered address (if the distribution recipient is a holder of the share), or (in any other case) to an address specified by the distribution recipient either in writing or as the directors may otherwise decide, sending a cheque made payable to such person by post to such person at such address as the distribution recipient has specified either in writing or as the directors may otherwise decide, or any other means of payment as the directors agree with the distribution recipient either in writing or by such other means as the directors decide. (2) \tIn the articles, “the distribution recipient” means, in respect of a share in respect of which a dividend or other sum is payable— the holder of the share, or if the share has two or more joint holders, whichever of them is named first in the register of members, or if the holder is no longer entitled to the share by reason of death or bankruptcy, or otherwise by operation of law, the transmittee. Deductions from distributions in respect of sums owed to the company (1) \tIf— a share is subject to the company’s lien, and the directors are entitled to issue a lien enforcement notice in respect of it, they may, instead of issuing a lien enforcement notice, deduct from any dividend or other sum payable in respect of the share any sum of money which is payable to the company in respect of that share to the extent that they are entitled to require payment under a lien enforcement notice. (2) \tMoney so deducted must be used to pay any of the sums payable in respect of that share. (3) \tThe company must notify the distribution recipient in writing of— the fact and amount of any such deduction, any non-payment of a dividend or other sum payable in respect of a share resulting from any such deduction, and how the money deducted has been applied. No interest on distributions The company may not pay interest on any dividend or other sum payable in respect of a share unless otherwise provided by— the terms on which the share was issued, or the provisions of another agreement between the holder of that share and the company. Unclaimed distributions (1) \tAll dividends or other sums which are— payable in respect of shares, and unclaimed after having been declared or become payable, may be invested or otherwise made use of by the directors for the benefit of the company until claimed. (2) \tThe payment of any such dividend or other sum into a separate account does not make the company a trustee in respect of it. (3) \tIf— twelve years have passed from the date on which a dividend or other sum became due for payment, and the distribution recipient has not claimed it, the distribution recipient is no longer entitled to that dividend or other sum and it ceases to remain owing by the company. Non-cash distributions (1) \tSubject to the terms of issue of the share in question, the company \tmay, by ordinary resolution on the recommendation of the directors, \tdecide to pay all or part of a dividend or other distribution payable in \trespect of a share by transferring non-cash assets of equivalent value \t(including, without limitation, shares or other securities in any company). (2) \tIf the shares in respect of which such a non-cash distribution is paid are uncertificated, any shares in the company which are issued as a non-cash distribution in respect of them must be uncertificated. (3) \tFor  the  purposes  of  paying  a  non-cash  distribution,  the  directors  may  make  whatever arrangements they think fit, including, where any difficulty arises regarding the distribution— fixing the value of any assets, paying cash to any distribution recipient on the basis of that value in order to adjust the rights of recipients, and vesting any assets in trustees. Waiver of distributions Distribution recipients may waive their entitlement to a dividend or other distribution payable in respect of a share by giving the company notice in writing to that effect, but if— the share has more than one holder, or more than one person is entitled to the share, whether by reason  of the death or bankruptcy of one or more joint holders, or otherwise, the notice is not effective unless it is expressed to be given, and signed, by all the holders or persons otherwise entitled to the share."

(4) \tNotice of a directors’ meeting need not be given to directors who waive their entitlement to notice of that meeting, by giving notice to that effect to the company not more than 7 days after the date on which the meeting is held. Where such notice is given after the meeting has been held, that does not affect the validity of the meeting, or of any business conducted at it. Participation in directors’ meetings (1) \tSubject  to  the  articles,  directors  participate  in  a  directors’  meeting,  \tor  part  of  a directors’ meeting, when— the meeting has been called and takes place in accordance with the articles, and they can each communicate to the others any information or opinions they have on any particular item of the business of the meeting.

(2) \tBut if paragraph (3) applies, a director who is interested in an actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the company is to be counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum and voting purposes. (3) \tThis paragraph applies when— the company by ordinary resolution disapplies the provision of the articles which would otherwise prevent a director from being counted as participating in the decision-making process, the director’s interest cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest, or the director’s conflict of interest arises from a permitted cause.

(6) \tSubject to paragraph (7), if a question arises at a meeting of directors or of a committee of directors as to the right of a director to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes, the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be referred to the chairman whose ruling in relation to any director other than the chairman is to be final and conclusive.

(2) \tThe chairman of the meeting may adjourn a general meeting at which a quorum is present if— the meeting consents to an adjournment, or it appears to the chairman of the meeting that an adjournment is necessary to protect the safety of any person attending the meeting or ensure that the business of the meeting is conducted in an orderly manner. (3) \tThe chairman of the meeting must adjourn a general meeting if directed to do so by the meeting. (4) \tWhen adjourning a general meeting, the chairman of the meeting must— either specify the time and place to which it is adjourned or state that it is to continue at a time and place to be fixed by the directors, and have regard to any directions as to the time and place of any adjournment which have been given by the meeting.

(6) \tNo business may be transacted at an adjourned general meeting which could not properly have been transacted at the meeting if the adjournment had not taken place."

    "clause_text": "Voting: general A resolution put to the vote of a general meeting must be decided on a show of hands unless a poll is duly demanded in accordance with the articles. Errors and disputes (1) \tNo objection may be raised to the qualification of any person voting \tat a general meeting except at the meeting or adjourned meeting at \twhich the vote objected to is tendered, and every vote not disallowed at \tthe meeting is valid. (2) \tAny such objection must be referred to the chairman of the meeting whose decision is final. Poll votes (1) \tA poll on a resolution may be demanded— in advance of the general meeting where it is to be put to the vote, or at a general meeting, either before a show of hands on that resolution or immediately after the result of a show of hands on that resolution is declared. (2) \tA poll may be demanded by— the chairman of the meeting, the directors, two or more persons having the right to vote on the resolution, or a person or persons representing not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the members having the right to vote on the resolution. (3) \tA demand for a poll may be withdrawn if— the poll has not yet been taken, and the chairman of the meeting consents to the withdrawal. (4) \tPolls must be taken immediately and in such manner as the chairman of the meeting directs. Content of proxy notices (1) \tProxies may only validly be appointed by a notice in writing (a  \t“proxy notice”) which— states the name and address of the member appointing the proxy, identifies the person appointed to be that member’s proxy and the general meeting in relation to which that person is appointed, is signed by or on behalf of the member appointing the proxy, or is authenticated in such manner as the directors may determine, and is delivered to the company in accordance with the articles and any instructions contained in the notice of the general meeting to which they relate. (2) \tThe company may require proxy notices to be delivered in a particular form, and may specify different forms for different purposes. (3) \tProxy notices may specify how the proxy appointed under them is to vote (or that the proxy is to abstain from voting) on one or more resolutions. (4) \tUnless a proxy notice indicates otherwise, it must be treated as— allowing the person appointed under it as a proxy discretion as to how to vote on any ancillary or procedural resolutions put to the meeting, and appointing that person as a proxy in relation to any adjournment of the general meeting to which it relates as well as the meeting itself. Delivery of proxy notices (1) \tA person who is entitled to attend, speak or vote (either on a show of \thands or on a poll) at a general meeting remains so entitled in respect of \tthat meeting or any adjournment of it, even though a valid proxy notice \thas been delivered to the company by or on behalf of that person. (2) \tAn appointment under a proxy notice may be revoked by delivering to the company a notice in writing given by or on behalf of the person by whom or on whose behalf the proxy notice was given. (3) \tA notice revoking a proxy appointment only takes effect if it is delivered before the start of the meeting or adjourned meeting to which it relates. (4) \tIf a proxy notice is not executed by the person appointing the proxy, it must be accompanied by written evidence of the authority of the person who executed it to execute it on the appointor’s behalf. Amendments to resolutions (1) \tAn ordinary resolution to be proposed at a general meeting may be  \tamended by ordinary resolution if— notice of the proposed amendment is given to the company in writing by a person entitled to vote at the general meeting at which it is to be proposed not less than 48 hours before the meeting is to take place (or such later time as the chairman of the meeting may determine), and the proposed amendment does not, in the reasonable opinion of the chairman of the meeting, materially alter the scope of the resolution. (2) \tA special resolution to be proposed at a general meeting may be amended by ordinary resolution, if— the chairman of the meeting proposes the amendment at the general meeting at which the resolution is to be proposed, and the amendment does not go beyond what is necessary to correct a grammatical or other non-substantive error in the resolution. (3) \tIf the chairman of the meeting, acting in good faith, wrongly decides that an amendment to a resolution is out of order, the chairman’s error does not invalidate the vote on that resolution."
